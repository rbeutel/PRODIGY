    "This assignment and notes notes have been adapted from: \n",

    "\n",
    "In this module we consider a simple linear dynamical model\n",
    "for Sea Surface Temperature (anomalies) data. The data are monthly anomalies\n",
    "from a January 1970 - March 2003 climatology (averaged over time). \n",
    "and are gridded at a resolution of 2 x 2 degrees between 124E - 70W and 30S - 30N. \n",
    "These data were obtained from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center \n",
    "as available in the IRI/LDEO\n",
    "Climate Data Library at Columbia University\n",
    "[http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.CAC/](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.CAC/). \n",
    "\n",
    "We have made this Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data available as three different \n",
    "plain-text files on Google drive. \n",
    "These are: `SSTlonlat.txt`, which contains the longitude and latitude\n",
    "of each observation (2520 rows, 2 columns), `SSTlandmask.txt` which is a 2520 long\n",
    "vector of 0/1 flags indicating whether the corresponding pixel is over land or \n",
    "water (\"`1`\" indicates land), and `SSTdata.txt` which contains 2520 rows and 399 columns. Each \n",
    "column corresponds to a 2520 vector of monthly SST measurements. \n",
    "For example, the observations for May 1992 for the 2520 locations \n",
    "can be found in column 269 ( `(1992 - 1970)*12 + 5 = 269`) (column 1 corresponds to January 1970).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use a simple dynamical model to obtain 6-month ahead forecasts. \n",
    "We will use data until April 1997 to predict the Oct 1997 anomalies. Since we have the Oct 1997 data, \n",
    "we will be able to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. Note that Oct 1997 was an\n",
    "El Nino month. \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain 6-month forecasts we will consider two approaches: one \n",
    "is the one discussed in class, based on a 6-month lag model (so that we model the evolution of the\n",
    "SST \"surface\" in 6-month steps). This document contains a detailed description of this\n",
    "approach, along with the corresponding `MATLAB` code. \n",
    "The other approach is based on a 1-month lag model. \n",
    "As discussed in class, to estimate the parameters of either of these\n",
    "models (lag-1 or lag-6) we will need to reduce the dimension of our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class notes below include all the code needed to reproduce the analysis \n",
    "discussed on Tuesday. The assignment (5 questions) can be\n",
    "found at the end of this document.  You may want to consider adapting the code\n",
    "in these class notes to work on the assignment. \n",
